# 13Fs

need to use N-Q or N-CSRS if 13F is not available

puts and calls throw off data from soros
if the title is not included in the header, add it to the end?

add everything as dict
find the highest len dict
make that the headers list

iterate through each other dict
if header exists in keys
add item value
otherwise add ''


need to create header first

check why headers is nested list
